The program is designed to manage vehicle access in a smart parking system. It monitors the entry and exit of vehicles and calculates the total time each vehicle spends in the parking lot.

As context:
Each vehicle is identified by a unique license plate number.
Vehicle entries and exits are automatically recorded through video cameras that detect license plates.
Access is allowed only if the vehicle is registered in a database of authorized vehicles.
The system will manage and track the vehicles' entry and exit times, ensuring proper billing or usage tracking based on the time spent in the parking lot.
